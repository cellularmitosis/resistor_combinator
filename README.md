===================

A script for calculating optimum arrangement of series / parallel resistors to hone in on an exact value.

How precise is a 1% resistor?  Dave Jones of EEVBlog made a great video exploring this topic.

If you have a bunch of the same nominal value resistors, you can arrange them in a series-parallel columns.  You retain the same nominal value, but if you carefully arrange them, you can greatly improve the precision of the overall value (and they run cooler as well, which reduces their temperature drift!).

These arrangements all have the same nominal value (1 ohm):
